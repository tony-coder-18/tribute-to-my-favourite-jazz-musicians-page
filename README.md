## Notes
- As for now, the scroll driven animations ONLY WORK ON CHROME desktop and mobile. This is because I'm using the CSS property `animation-timeline: scroll()` and that property is only available con Chrome for now (9/12/2024). [See Can I use page for more and lastest info](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_animation-timeline_scroll).
- Currently is not mobile optimized.
